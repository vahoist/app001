In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n * \n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n * \n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n * \n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n * \n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n * \n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({ \n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n * \n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n * \n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n * \n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n * \n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence.

If a query\n * has the `optional` flag set to true then this error will be ignored.\n * \n * ```js\n * query('.some-element-that-may-not-be-there', [\n *   animate(...),\n *   animate(...)\n * ], { optional: true })\n * ```\n * \n * ### Special Selector Values\n * \n * The selector value within a query can collect elements that contain angular-specific\n * characteristics\n * using special pseudo-selectors tokens.\n * \n * These include:\n * \n *  - Querying for newly inserted/removed elements using `query(\":enter\")`/`query(\":leave\")`\n *  - Querying all currently animating elements using `query(\":animating\")`\n *  - Querying elements that contain an animation trigger using `query(\"\\@triggerName\")`\n *  - Querying all elements that contain an animation triggers using `query(\"\\@*\")`\n *  - Including the current element into the animation sequence using `query(\":self\")`\n * \n * \n *  Each of these pseudo-selector tokens can be merged together into a combined query selector\n * string:\n * \n *  ```\n *  query(':self, .record:enter, .record:leave, \\@subTrigger', [...])\n *  ```\n * \n * ### Demo\n * \n * ```\n * \\@Component({ \n *   selector: 'inner',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@queryAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       <h1>Title</h1>\n *       <div class=\"content\">\n *         Blah blah blah\n *       </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *    trigger('queryAnimation', [\n *      transition('* => goAnimate', [\n *        // hide the inner elements\n *        query('h1', style({ opacity: 0 })),\n *        query('.content', style({ opacity: 0 })),\n * \n *        // animate the inner elements in, one by one\n *        query('h1', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),\n *        query('.content', animate(1000, style({ opacity: 1 })),\n *      ])\n *    ])\n *  ]\n * })\n * class Cmp {\n *   exp = '';\n * \n *   goAnimate() {\n *     this.exp = 'goAnimate';\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} selector\n * @param {?} animation\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function query(\n    selector: string, animation: AnimationMetadata | AnimationMetadata[],\n    options: AnimationQueryOptions | null = null): AnimationQueryMetadata {\n  return {type: AnimationMetadataType.Query, selector, animation, options};\n}\n/**\n * `stagger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. It is designed to be used inside of an animation {\\@link query query()}\n * and works by issuing a timing gap between after each queried item is animated.\n * \n * ### Usage\n * \n * In the example below there is a container element that wraps a list of items stamped out\n * by an ngFor. The container element contains an animation trigger that will later be set\n * to query for each of the inner items.\n * \n * ```html\n * <!-- list.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"toggle()\">Show / Hide Items</button>\n * <hr />\n * <div [\\@listAnimation]=\"items.length\">\n *   <div *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n *     {{ item }}\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n * \n * The component code for this looks as such:\n * \n * ```ts\n * import {trigger, transition, style, animate, query, stagger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({ \n *   templateUrl: 'list.component.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('listAnimation', [\n *        //...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ListComponent {\n *   items = [];\n * \n *   showItems() {\n *     this.items = [0,1,2,3,4];\n *   }\n * \n *   hideItems() {\n *     this.items = [];\n *   }\n * \n *   toggle() {\n *     this.items.length ? this.hideItems() : this.showItems();\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * And now for the animation trigger code:\n * \n * ```ts\n * trigger('listAnimation', [\n *   transition('* => *', [ // each time the binding value changes\n *     query(':leave', [\n *       stagger(100, [\n *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 0 }))\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     query(':enter', [\n *       style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *       stagger(100, [\n *         animate('0.5s', style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ])\n * ])\n * ```\n * \n * Now each time the items are added/removed then either the opacity\n * fade-in animation will run or each removed item will be faded out.\n * When either of these animations occur then a stagger effect will be\n * applied after each item's animation is started.\n * \n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?} animation\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function stagger(\n    timings: string | number,\n    animation: AnimationMetadata | AnimationMetadata[]): AnimationStaggerMetadata {\n  return {type: AnimationMetadataType.Stagger, timings, animation};\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ../../../../packages/animations/src/animation_metadata.ts","\n/**\n * @license \n * Copyright Google Inc.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n * \n * ### Local Variables\n * \n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n * \n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n * \n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Change Propagation\n * \n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n * \n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n * \n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n * \n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgForOf` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * \n * With `<ng-template>` element:\n * \n * ```\n * <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgForOf<T> implements DoCheck, OnChanges {\n   ngForOf: NgIterable<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTrackBy(fn: TrackByFunction<T>) {\n    if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n      if ( /** @type {?} */((<any>console)) && /** @type {?} */(( <any>console.warn))) {\n        console.warn(\n            `trackBy must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}. ` +\n            `See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.`);\n      }\n    }\n    this._trackByFn = fn;\n  }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget ngForTrackBy(): TrackByFunction<T> { return this._trackByFn; }\nprivate _differ: IterableDiffer<T>|null = null;\nprivate _trackByFn: TrackByFunction<T>;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} _template\n * @param {?} _differs\n */\nconstructor(\nprivate _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,\nprivate _template: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>,\nprivate _differs: IterableDiffers) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngForTemplate(value: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T>>) {\n    // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n    // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n    // should be acceptable.\n    if (value) {\n      this._template = value;\n    }\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n    if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n      // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n      const /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n      if (!this._differ && value) {\n        try {\n          this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n        } catch ( /** @type {?} */e) {\n          throw new Error(\n              `Cannot find a differ supporting object '${value}' of type '${getTypeNameForDebugging(value)}'.

Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n * \n * ## Using non-inlined `then` template\n * \n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n * \n * ## Storing conditional result in a variable\n * \n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n * \n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n * \n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n * \n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n * \n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n * \n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n * \n * ### Syntax\n * \n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n * \n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgIf {\nprivate _context: NgIfContext = new NgIfContext();\nprivate _thenTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\nprivate _elseTemplateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\nprivate _thenViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\nprivate _elseViewRef: EmbeddedViewRef<NgIfContext>|null = null;\n/**\n * @param {?} _viewContainer\n * @param {?} templateRef\n */\nconstructor(private _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {\n    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} condition\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngIf(condition: any) {\n    this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n    this._updateView();\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} templateRef\n * @return {?}\n */\nset ngIfThen(templateRef: TemplateRef<NgIfContext>) {\n    this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    this._thenViewRef = null;

This DSL approach to describing\n   * animations allows for a flexibility that both benefits developers and the framework.\n   *\n   * Animations work by listening on state changes that occur on an element within\n   * the template. When a state change occurs, Angular can then take advantage and animate the\n   * arc in between. This works similar to how CSS transitions work, however, by having a\n   * programmatic DSL, animations are not limited to environments that are DOM-specific.\n   * (Angular can also perform optimizations behind the scenes to make animations more performant.)\n   *\n   * For animations to be available for use, animation state changes are placed within\n   * {@link trigger animation triggers} which are housed inside of the `animations` annotation\n   * metadata. Within a trigger both {@link state state} and {@link transition transition} entries\n   * can be placed.\n   *\n   * ```typescript\n   * @Component({\n   *   selector: 'animation-cmp',\n   *   templateUrl: 'animation-cmp.html',\n   *   animations: [\n   *     // this here is our animation trigger that\n   *     // will contain our state change animations.\n   *     trigger('myTriggerName', [\n   *       // the styles defined for the `on` and `off`\n   *       // states declared below are persisted on the\n   *       // element once the animation completes.\n   *       state('on', style({ opacity: 1 }),\n   *       state('off', style({ opacity: 0 }),\n   *\n   *       // this here is our animation that kicks off when\n   *       // this state change jump is true\n   *       transition('on => off', [\n   *         animate(\"1s\")\n   *       ])\n   *     ])\n   *   ]\n   * })\n   * ```\n   *\n   * As depicted in the code above, a group of related animation states are all contained within\n   * an animation `trigger` (the code example above called the trigger `myTriggerName`).\n   * When a trigger is created then it can be bound onto an element within the component's\n   * template via a property prefixed by an `@` symbol followed by trigger name and an expression\n   * that\n   * is used to determine the state value for that trigger.\n   *\n   * ```html\n   * <!-- animation-cmp.html -->\n   * <div @myTriggerName=\"expression\">...</div>\n   * ```\n   *\n   * For state changes to be executed, the `expression` value must change value from its existing\n   * value\n   * to something that we have set an animation to animate on (in the example above we are listening\n   * to a change of state between `on` and `off`).

In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n * \n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n * \n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n * \n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n * \n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n * \n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({ \n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n * \n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n * \n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n * \n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n * \n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence.

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n * \n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n * \n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n * \n * #### Syntax\n * \n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n * \n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n * \n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n * \n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class SelectControlValueAccessor implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  value: any;\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_optionMap: Map<string, any> = new Map<string, any>();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_idCounter: number = 0;\n\n  onChange = (_: any) => {};\n  onTouched = () => {};\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nset compareWith(fn: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean) {\n    if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error(`compareWith must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}`);\n    }\n    this._compareWith = fn;\n  }\nprivate _compareWith: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean = looseIdentical;\n/**\n * @param {?} _renderer\n * @param {?} _elementRef\n */\nconstructor(private _renderer: Renderer,\nprivate _elementRef: ElementRef) {}\n/**\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\nwriteValue(value: any): void {\n    this.value = value;\n    const /** @type {?} */ id: string|null = this._getOptionId(value);\n    if (id == null) {\n      this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n    }\n    const /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n    this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nregisterOnChange(fn: (value: any) => any): void {\n    this.onChange = (valueString: string) => {\n      this.value = valueString;\n      fn(this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n    };\n  }\n/**\n * @param {?} fn\n * @return {?}\n */\nregisterOnTouched(fn: () => any): void { this.onTouched = fn; }\n/**\n * @param {?} isDisabled\n * @return {?}\n */\nsetDisabledState(isDisabled: boolean): void {\n    this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n  }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @return {?}\n */\n_registerOption(): string { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @param {?} value\n * @return {?}\n */\n_getOptionId(value: any): string|null {\n    for (const /** @type {?} */ id of Array.from(this._optionMap.keys())) {\n      if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value)) return id;\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n/**\n * \\@internal\n * @param {?} valueString\n * @return {?}\n */\n_getOptionValue(valueString: string): any {\n    const /** @type {?} */ id: string = _extractId(valueString);\n    return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n * \n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n * \n * \\@howToUse \n * \n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n * \n * ### Example\n * \n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n * \n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n * \n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n * \n * ### Adding or removing controls\n * \n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n * \n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * \\@stable\n */\nexport class FormArray extends AbstractControl {\n/**\n * @param {?} controls\n * @param {?=} validator\n * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n */\nconstructor(\npublic controls: AbstractControl[], validator?: ValidatorFn|null,\n      asyncValidator?: AsyncValidatorFn|null) {\n    super(validator || null, asyncValidator || null);\n    this._initObservables();\n    this._setUpControls();\n    this.updateValueAndValidity({onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false});\n  }\n/**\n * Get the {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @return {?}\n */\nat(index: number): AbstractControl { return this.controls[index]; }\n/**\n * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\npush(control: AbstractControl): void {\n    this.controls.push(control);\n    this._registerControl(control);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Insert a new {\\@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\ninsert(index: number, control: AbstractControl): void {\n    this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n\n    this._registerControl(control);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n * @param {?} index\n * @return {?}\n */\nremoveAt(index: number): void {\n    if (this.controls[index]) this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(() => {});\n    this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Replace an existing control.\n * @param {?} index\n * @param {?} control\n * @return {?}\n */\nsetControl(index: number, control: AbstractControl): void {\n    if (this.controls[index]) this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(() => {});\n    this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n\n    if (control) {\n      this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n      this._registerControl(control);\n    }\n\n    this.updateValueAndValidity();\n    this._onCollectionChange();\n  }\n/**\n * Length of the control array.\n * @return {?}\n */\nget length(): number { return this.controls.length; }\n/**\n *  Sets the value of the {\\@link FormArray}.

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n * \n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n * \n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n * \n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n * \n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n * \n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n * \n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n * \n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n * \n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n * \n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n * \n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n * \n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n * \n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport class NgModel extends NgControl implements OnChanges,\n    OnDestroy {\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_control = new FormControl();\n/**\n * \\@internal\n */\n_registered = false;\n  viewModel: any;\n\n   name: string;\n   isDisabled: boolean;\n   model: any;\n   options: {name?: string, standalone?: boolean};\n\n   update = new EventEmitter();\n/**\n * @param {?} parent\n * @param {?} validators\n * @param {?} asyncValidators\n * @param {?} valueAccessors\n */\nconstructor(  parent: ControlContainer,\n                 validators: Array<Validator|ValidatorFn>,\n                 asyncValidators: Array<AsyncValidator|AsyncValidatorFn>,\n                \n              valueAccessors: ControlValueAccessor[]) {\n                super();\n                this._parent = parent;\n                this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n                this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n                this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n              }\n/**\n * @param {?} changes\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {\n                this._checkForErrors();\n                if (!this._registered) this._setUpControl();\n                if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n                  this._updateDisabled(changes);\n                }\n\n                if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n                  this._updateValue(this.model);\n                  this.viewModel = this.model;\n                }\n              }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nngOnDestroy(): void { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget control(): FormControl { return this._control; }\n/**\n * @return {?}\n */\nget path(): string[] {\n                return this._parent ?

Each one has the following properties:\n *\n * - `path` is a string that uses the route matcher DSL.\n * - `pathMatch` is a string that specifies the matching strategy.\n * - `matcher` defines a custom strategy for path matching and supersedes `path` and `pathMatch`.\n * - `component` is a component type.\n * - `redirectTo` is the url fragment which will replace the current matched segment.\n * - `outlet` is the name of the outlet the component should be placed into.\n * - `canActivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivate} for more info.\n * - `canActivateChild` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanActivateChild handlers. See\n *   {@link CanActivateChild} for more info.\n * - `canDeactivate` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanDeactivate handlers. See\n *   {@link CanDeactivate} for more info.\n * - `canLoad` is an array of DI tokens used to look up CanLoad handlers. See\n *   {@link CanLoad} for more info.\n * - `data` is additional data provided to the component via `ActivatedRoute`.\n * - `resolve` is a map of DI tokens used to look up data resolvers. See {@link Resolve} for more\n *   info.\n * - `runGuardsAndResolvers` defines when guards and resolvers will be run. By default they run only\n *    when the matrix parameters of the route change. When set to `paramsOrQueryParamsChange` they\n *    will also run when query params change. And when set to `always`, they will run every time.\n * - `children` is an array of child route definitions.\n * - `loadChildren` is a reference to lazy loaded child routes. See {@link LoadChildren} for more\n *   info.\n *\n * ### Simple Configuration\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n  *  component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/bob`, the router will create the team component with the user\n * component in it.\n *\n * ### Multiple Outlets\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team\n * }, {\n *   path: 'chat/:user',\n *   component: Chat\n *   outlet: 'aux'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11(aux:chat/jim)`, the router will create the team component next to\n * the chat component. The chat component will be placed into the aux outlet.\n *\n * ### Wild Cards\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '**',\n *   component: Sink\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Regardless of where you navigate to, the router will instantiate the sink component.\n *\n * ### Redirects\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',\n *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router will change the url to\n * '/team/11/user/jim', and then will instantiate the team component with the user component\n * in it.\n *\n * If the `redirectTo` value starts with a '/', then it is an absolute redirect. E.g., if in the\n * example above we change the `redirectTo` to `/user/:name`, the result url will be '/user/jim'.\n *\n * ### Empty Path\n *\n * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'\n * any url segments. Let's look at the following configuration:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: AllUsers\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11`, the router will instantiate the AllUsers component.\n *\n * Empty-path routes can have children.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: WrapperCmp,\n *     children: [{\n *       path: 'user/:name',\n *       component: User\n *     }]\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * When navigating to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router will instantiate the wrapper component with\n * the user component in it.\n *\n * An empty path route inherits its parent's params and data. This is because it cannot have its\n * own params, and, as a result, it often uses its parent's params and data as its own.\n *\n * ### Matching Strategy\n *\n * By default the router will look at what is left in the url, and check if it starts with\n * the specified path (e.g., `/team/11/user` starts with `team/:id`).\n *\n * We can change the matching strategy to make sure that the path covers the whole unconsumed url,\n * which is akin to `unconsumedUrl === path` or `$` regular expressions.\n *\n * This is particularly important when redirecting empty-path routes.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Since an empty path is a prefix of any url, even when navigating to '/main', the router will\n * still apply the redirect.\n *\n * If `pathMatch: full` is provided, the router will apply the redirect if and only if navigating to\n * '/'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'full',\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Componentless Routes\n *\n * It is useful at times to have the ability to share parameters between sibling components.\n *\n * Say we have two components--ChildCmp and AuxCmp--that we want to put next to each other and both\n * of them require some id parameter.\n *\n * One way to do that would be to have a bogus parent component, so both the siblings can get the id\n * parameter from it. This is not ideal. Instead, you can use a componentless route.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * So when navigating to `parent/10/(a//aux:b)`, the route will instantiate the main child and aux\n * child components next to each other. In this example, the application component\n * has to have the primary and aux outlets defined.\n *\n * The router will also merge the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the componentless parent into\n * the `params`, `data`, and `resolve` of the children. This is done because there is no component\n * that can inject the activated route of the componentless parent.\n *\n * This is especially useful when child components are defined as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: '', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * With this configuration in place, navigating to '/parent/10' will create the main child and aux\n * components.\n *\n * ### Lazy Loading\n *\n * Lazy loading speeds up our application load time by splitting it into multiple bundles, and\n * loading them on demand. The router is designed to make lazy loading simple and easy.

It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n   * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() { // We actually could just remote this method,\n   *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   * .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n   * .subscribe(\n   *   function(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   function() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);\n   *   }\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>\n   * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(\n   *   num => console.log(num),\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even\n   * );                                // when cancelling subscription\n   *\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2,5s\n   *\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

an Observable.</span>\n *\n * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule\n * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function observeOn<T>(this: Observable<T>, scheduler: IScheduler, delay: number = 0): Observable<T> {\n  return this.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private scheduler: IScheduler, private delay: number = 0) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\n    return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n  static dispatch(this: Action<ObserveOnMessage>, arg: ObserveOnMessage) {\n    const { notification, destination } = arg;\n    notification.observe(destination);\n    this.unsubscribe();\n  }\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              private scheduler: IScheduler,\n              private delay: number = 0) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  private scheduleMessage(notification: Notification<any>): void {\n    this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(\n      ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch,\n      this.delay,\n      new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)\n    ));\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\n  }\n\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\n  }\n\n  protected _complete(): void {\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\n  }\n}\n\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\n  constructor(public notification: Notification<any>,\n              public destination: PartialObserver<any>) {\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/rxjs/src/operator/observeOn.ts","import { Observable } from '../Observable';\nimport { Operator } from '../Operator';\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\n\n/* tslint:disable:max-line-length */\nexport function reduce<T>(this: Observable<T>, accumulator: (acc: T, value: T, index: number) => T, seed?: T): Observable<T>;\nexport function reduce<T>(this: Observable<T>, accumulator: (acc: T[], value: T, index: number) => T[], seed: T[]): Observable<T[]>;\nexport function reduce<T, R>(this: Observable<T>, accumulator: (acc: R, value: T, index: number) => R, seed: R): Observable<R>;\n/* tslint:enable:max-line-length */\n\n/**\n * Applies an accumulator function over the source Observable, and returns the\n * accumulated result when the source completes, given an optional seed value.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Combines together all values emitted on the source,\n * using an accumulator function that knows how to join a new source value into\n * the accumulation from the past.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/reduce.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * Like\n * [Array.prototype.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce),\n * `reduce` applies an `accumulator` function against an accumulation and each\n * value of the source Observable (from the past) to reduce it to a single\n * value, emitted on the output Observable.
